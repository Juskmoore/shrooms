###Magic Mushrooms Recipe 
**This guide is based on Robert “Psylocybe Fanaticus” McPherson’s eponymous PF Tek—the method that revolutionized psilocybin mushroom cultivation. McPherson’s key innovation was to add vermiculite to a grain-based substrate (as opposed to using grain alone), giving the mycelium more space to grow and mimicking natural conditions. Although his method is a little more labor-intensive than others, often for a lower yield, its simplicity, low cost, and reliability makes it ideally suited to beginners. It also makes use of readily available materials and ingredients, many of which you may already have.**

## Ingredients

* Spore syringe, 10-12 cc
* Organic brown rice flour
* Vermiculite, medium/fine
* Drinking water

##Equipment
* Hammer and small nail
* Measure Cup
* Mixing Bowl
* Strainer
* Micropore Tape

###Hygiene Supplies
* Rubbing Alcohol
* Butane/ propane torch lighter
* Surface disinfectant
* Air sanitizer

#Instructions

**STEP 1: PREPARATION
1) Prepare jars:

With the hammer and nail (which should be wiped with alcohol to disinfect) punch four holes down through each of the lids, evenly spaced around their circumferences.
2) Prepare substrate:

For each jar, thoroughly combine 2/3 cup vermiculite and 1/4 cup water in the mixing bowl. Drain excess water using the disinfected strainer.
Add 1/4 cup brown rice flour per half-pint jar to the bowl and combine with the moist vermiculite.
3) Fill jars:

Being careful not to pack too tightly, fill the jars to within a half-inch of the rims.
Sterilize this top half-inch with rubbing alcohol
Top off your jars with a layer of dry vermiculite to insulate the substrate from contaminants.
4) Steam sterilize:

Tightly screw on the lids and cover the jars with tin foil. Secure the edges of the foil around the sides of the jars to prevent water and condensation getting through the holes.
Place the small towel (or paper towels) into the large cooking pot and arrange the jars on top, ensuring they don’t touch the base.
Add tap water to a level halfway up the sides of the jars and bring to a slow boil, ensuring the jars remain upright.
Place the tight-fitting lid on the pot and leave to steam for 75-90 minutes. If the pot runs dry, replenish with hot tap water.
Note: Some growers prefer to use a pressure cooker set for 60 minutes at 15PSI

5) Allow to cool:

After steaming, leave the foil-covered jars in the pot for several hours or overnight. They need to be at room temperature before the next step.
